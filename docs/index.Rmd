## "Dynamic Paragraph" *Replace with real header pls
In our exploratory analysis, we looked into the information in the three .csv files we've already selected. These statistics are a good start, but we may need to supplement our analysis with other data in order to connect our areas of interest. 

### Hospital summary: 


## Table: Number of Open Hospitals 
```{r echo = FALSE}
hospital_info <- hospital_info
kable(hospital_info)
```
